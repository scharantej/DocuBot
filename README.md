### **Flask Application Design for Chatbot**

#### **HTML Files**

1. **chatbot.html**: This is the main HTML file that serves as the user interface for the chatbot. It includes the necessary HTML elements and a form for users to enter their questions.
2. **chatbot_result.html**: This HTML file displays the response generated by the chatbot based on the user's question. It includes the chatbot's response message and the documentation reference used to generate it.

#### **Routes**

1. **index**: This route renders the chatbot.html file, presenting the chatbot interface to the user.
2. **chatbot_response**: This route handles the user's question. It extracts the question from the request, processes it to extract keywords, searches the documentation for relevant information, and generates a response. The response and the documentation reference are then rendered in the chatbot_result.html template.
